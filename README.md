## Usage

To use the AniList TypeScript Wrapper in your TypeScript project, import the necessary classes and functions:

```

Then, create an instance of the AniList class, optionally providing an access token:

```

You can now use the anilist object to access various functionalities of the AniList API. See the next section for details on available functionality.

## Authentication
Authentication is required to access certain endpoints and perform actions on behalf of a user. To authenticate with the AniList API, you need to obtain an access token. Visit the AniList website and follow their documentation to generate an access token. When creating an instance of the AniList class, you can provide the access token as a parameter to enable authenticated access to specific features.
